***Notes***: 

* The environment was set up using GMS version 2022.9.1.51. 
* I take credit for all assets.
* Object code for player and walls is credited to tutorials with slight modifications, the rest was my own.
* My goal is to create a enjoyable and creative platformer game.
* The doors are holes that let you travel through the levels of the book.
* Spacebar is the start button.
* Wrong way doors are shown to be darker then regular doors.
* Progress through the levels in any way you want, all are unlocked.
